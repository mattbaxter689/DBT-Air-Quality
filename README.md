# DBT Weather

This dbt portion of the project is just for some simple transformations to apply. I want to expand my understanding of dbt, which is why some transformations may seem redundant or unused. It is simply for me to expand my understanding of the technology as a whole. Also, I want to expand upon this entire project as time goes on, which includes the models used, and the extent of which I use them.

For the future I'd like to improve the documentation of the models including:
- model ownership
- model tags

I'd also like to add other models including:
- models reporting change in pollutant levels (delta) from one hour to the next, day to day, etc
- Adding flags when deltas reach a certain threshold to raise pollutant level flags
- Create my train/val/test splits automatically with dbt models, rather than performing that portion with python

Overall, I'm using this project in tandem with everything else to improve upon my skills and develop a deeper understanding of technologies used in industry more often.
